There are many different ways for expressing laws of science in \\ngeneral and laws of physics in particular. Similar to physical laws of nature, information \\ncan also be expressed in different ways. The fact that information can be expressed in \\ndifferent ways without losing its essential nature, leads for the possibility of the automatic \\nmanipulation of information. \\n All ways of expressing information use physical system, spoken words are \\nconveyed by air pressure fluctuations: “ No information without physical representation” . \\nThe fact that information is insensitive to exactly how it is expressed and can be freely \\ntranslated from one form to another, makes it an obvious candidate for fundamentally \\nimportant role in physics, like interaction, energy, momentum and other such abstractors. \\nThis is a project report on the general attributes of Quantum Computing and Information \\nProcessing from a layman’s point of view. \\n \\nKeywords: computation, EPR, quantum mechanics, superposition, unitary \\ntransformation, decoherence. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The history of computer development represents the \\nculmination of years of technological advancements beginning with the early ideas of \\nCharles Babbage and eventual creation of the first computer by German engineer Konard \\nZeise in 1941. The whole process involved a sequence of changes from one type of \\nphysical realization to another from gears to relays to valves to transistors to integrated \\ncircuits to chip and so on. Surprisingly however, the high speed modern computer is \\nfundamentally no different from its gargantuan 30 ton ancestors which were equipped \\nwith some 18000 vacuum tubes and 500 miles of wiring. Although computers have \\nbecome more compact and considerably faster in performing their task, the task remains \\nthe same: to manipulate and interpret an encoding of binary bits into a useful \\ncomputational result. \\n \\n      The number of atoms needed to represent a bit of memory has been decreasing \\nexponentially since 1950. An observation by Gordon Moore in 1965 laid the foundations \\nfor what came to be known as “ Moore’s Law”  –  that computer processing power doubles \\nevery eighteen months. If Moore’s Law is extrapolated naively to the future, it is learnt \\nthat sooner or later, each bit of information should be encoded by a physical system of \\nsubatomic size. As a matter of fact this point is substantiated by the survey made by \\nKeyes in 1988 as shown in fig. 1. This plot shows the number of electrons required to \\nstore a single bit of information. An extrapolation of the plot suggests that we might be \\nwithin the reach of atomic scale computations with in a decade or so at the atomic scale \\nhowever. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        Year    \\n   Fig 1:  Showing number of dopant impurities in logic in bipolar transistors with year. \\n \\n \\n1014  \\n     \\n1012 \\n \\n1010 \\n \\n108 \\n \\n106 \\n \\n104 \\n \\n102 \\n \\n1 \\n \\n \\n1950    1970    1980    1990    2000    2010 \\nNo. Of \\nImpurities ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Watson Research Centre, Paul A. Beniof of Arogonne \\nNational Laboratory in Illinois, David Deustch of the University of Oxford and Richard \\nP. Feynman of Caltech. The idea emerged when scientists were pondering on the \\nfundamental limits of computation. In 1982 Feynman was among the fewer to attempt to \\nprovide conceptually a new kind of computers which could be devised based on the \\nprinciples of quantum physics. He constructed an abstract model to show how a quantum \\nsystem could be used to do computations and also explain how such a machine would be \\nable to act as a simulator for physical problems pertaining to quantum physics. In other \\nwords, a physicist would have the ability to carry out experiments in quantum physics \\ninside a quantum mechanical computer. Feynman further analysed that quantum \\ncomputers can solve quantum mechanical many body problems that are impractical to \\nsolve on a classical computer. This is due to the fact that solutions on a classical \\ncomputer would require exponentially growing time where as the whole calculations on \\nquantum computer can be done in polynomial time. \\n          \\n        Later, in 1985, Deutsch realized that Feynman assertion could eventually lead to a \\ngeneral-purpose quantum computer. He showed that any physical process, in principle \\ncould be modelled perfectly by a quantum computer. Thus, a quantum computer would \\nhave capabilities far beyond those of any traditional classical computer. Consequently \\nefforts were made to find interesting applications for such a machine. This did not lead to \\nmuch success except continuing few mathematical problems. Peter Shor in 1994 set out a \\nmethod for using quantum computers to crack an important problem in number theory \\nwhich was namely factorisation. He showed how an ensemble of mathematical \\noperations, designed specifically for a quantum computer could be organized to make \\nsuch a machine to factor huge numbers extremely rapidly, much faster than is possible on \\nconventional computers. With this breakthrough, quantum computing transformed from a \\nmere academic curiosity directly to an interest world over. \\n          \\n        Perhaps the most astonishing fact about quantum computing is that it took \\nexceedingly large time to take off. Physicists have known since 1920’s that the world of \\nsubatomic particles is a realm apart, but it took computer scientists another half century \\nto begin wondering whether quantum effects might be harnessed for computation.

In these systems users do not need to \\nagree on a secret key before they send the message. The principle of a safe with two keys, \\none public key to lock it, and another private one to open it, is employed. Everyone has a \\nkey to lock the safe but one person has a key that will open it again, so anyone can put a \\nmessage in the safe but only one person can take it out. In practice the two keys are two \\nlarge integer numbers. One can easily derive a public key from a private key but not vice \\nversa. The system exploits the fact that certain mathematical operations are easier to \\nperform in one direction that the other e.g. multiplication of numbers can be performed \\nmuch faster than factorising a large number. What really counts for a “ fast”  algorithm is \\nnot the actual time taken to multiply a particular pairs of numbers but the fact that the \\ntime does not increase too sharply when we apply the same method to ever-large \\nnumbers. We know that multiplication requires little extra time when we switch from two \\nthree digit numbers to two thirty digit numbers using the simpler trial division method \\nabout 10Ù13 times more time or memory consuming than factoring a three digit number. \\nIn case of factorisation the use of computational resources is enormous when we keep on \\nincreasing the number of digits. As a matter of fact public key cryptosystems could avoid \\nkey distribution problem. However their security depends upon unproven mathematical \\nassumptions such as the difficulty of factoring large integers. Nevertheless one such \\nprotocol is RSA, which maps electronic banking possible by assuming banks and their \\ncustomers that a bogus transfer of funds or a successful forgery would take the world’s \\nfastest computer millions of years to carry out. Another is the under spread Data \\nEncryption Standard (DES) which remains secure far most ordinary business \\ntransactions.  \\n \\n          The procedure of factorising a large integer can be quantified as follows. Consider \\na number N with L decimal digits (N ~ 10 to power L). The number is factored using trial \\ndivision method. On conventional computers one of well known factoring algorithm runs \\nfor number of operations of the order of  \\n \\ns ~ O (exp ( (64/9)1/3 (lnN)1/3 (ln lnN)2/3 )) \\nor explicitly,   s ~ A exp ( 1.9 L1/3 ( lnL)2/3 ) \\n \\n \\nThis algorithm therefore, scales exponentially with the input size log N (log N determines \\nthe length of the input. The base of the logarithm is determined by our numbering system. \\nThus base 2 gives the length in binary, a base 2 gives the length in binary, a base of 10 in \\ndecimal and so on) e.g. in 1994 a 129 digit number (known as RSA 129) was successfully \\nfactored using this algorithm on approximately 1600 workstations scattered around the \\nworld, the entire factorisation took eight months. Using this to estimate the per factor of \\nthe above exponential scaling, it is found that it would take roughly 800,000 years to \\nfactor a 250 digit number with the same computer power, similarly a 1000 digit number \\nwould require 10 to the power 25 years (much longer than the age of universe).

However it turns out that \\nthis is not the case. The Classical Theory of Computation is not complete simply because \\nit does not describe all physically possible computations. In particular, it does not \\ndescribe computations, which can be performed by quantum devices. Indeed, recent work \\nin quantum computation shows that a quantum computer can factor much faster than any \\nclassical computer. According to an algorithm developed by Peter Shor factoring an \\ninteger using quantum computer runs in O((lnN) 2+e) steps, where e is small. This is \\nroughly quadratic in the input size, so factoring a 1000 digit number with such an \\nalgorithm would require only few million steps.

However, a system of \\nN particles in classical physics can be simulated with a polynomial slowdown. The main \\nreason for this is that the description size of a particle system is linear in N in classical \\nphysics but exponential in N according to quantum computer (computer based on the \\nlaws of quantum mechanics) can avoid the slowdown encountered in the simulation \\nprocess of quantum systems.

The difficulty is not so much that \\nmicroprocessors are too slow; it is that computers are inherently inefficient. Modern \\n(classical) computers operate according to programs that divide a task into elementary \\noperations, which are then carried out serially, one operation at a time. Efforts have been \\nmade to coax two or more computers (or at least two or more microprocessors) to work \\non different aspects of a problem at the same time, but the progress in such parallel \\ncomputing has been slow and fitful. The reason to a large extent is that the logic built into \\nmicroprocessors is inherently serial (normal computers sometimes appear to be doing \\nmany tasks at once, such as running both a word processor and spreadsheet programme, \\nbut in reality, the central processor is simply cycling rapidly from one task to the next).  \\n \\n       In a true sense, parallel computer would have simultaneity built into its very nature. \\nIt would be able to carry out many operations at once, to search instantly through a long \\nlist of possibilities and point out the one that solves the problem. Such computers do \\nexist. They are called quantum computers. In reality, the more exciting feature of \\nquantum computing is quantum parallelism. A quantum system in general is not in one \\n“ classical state”  but in a “ quantum state”  consisting (broadly speaking) in a superposition \\nof many classical or classical like states. This is called principle of linear superposition \\nused to construct quantum states. If the superposition can be protected from unwanted \\nentanglement with its environment (known as decoherence) a quantum computer can \\noutput results depending on details of all its classical like states. This is quantum \\nparallelism- parallelism on a serial machine. \\n \\n2.4 QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION AND QUANTUM INTERFERENCE: Conceptual \\nvisualization of quantum computer. \\n        \\n       In a quantum computer the fundamental unit of information (is called a quantum bit \\nor “ qubit” , analogous to classical bit used in ordinary computer), is not binary but rather \\nmore quaternary in nature. This qubit property arises as direct consequence of its \\nadherence to the laws of quantum motions. A qubit can exist not only in a state \\ncorresponding to the logical state 0 or 1 as in a classical state bit but also in states \\ncorresponding to a blend of superposition of those classical states. In other words a qubit \\ncan exist as a zero, a one, or simultaneously as both 0 and 1, with numerical coefficient \\nrepresenting the probability for each state. This concept may appear to be counterintuitive \\nbecause every day phenomenon is governed by classical physics, not quantum \\nmechanics, which taps out at the atomic level. Physically qubit can be visualized by the \\nspin s=1/2 of one electron system, the two state +1/2 and – 1/2 being two eigenstates of Sz \\n(z component direction of an external magnetic field of spin ½.). Alternatively a beam of \\nsingle photon can also be used, the total states being the state of polarization (horizontal \\nor vertical) with respect to some chosen axis. Thus qubit can take 2 values, 0 or 1, which \\nare associated with two eigenstates of a spin of a single electron (say): \\n    |1> = |\\xad> \\n    |0> = |¯> \\n                                      |0> +  |1> =  |\\xad> +  |¯> ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In \\nmathematical terms, we say that since the general state of a qubit can be superposition of \\ntwo pure states with arbitrary complex coefficients, then the state is described as a vector \\nin the two dimensional complex space c2 and the two pure states form the basis of the \\nrepresentation. \\n \\n       Experimentally the phenomenon of quantum superposition can be demonstrated as \\nfollows. Consider figure 2.  \\n                                               \\n                                        \\n \\n \\n                                                 Fig 2: Beam splitting of light \\n \\n \\n \\nHere a light source emits a photon along a path towards a half-silvered mirror. This \\nmirror splits the light, reflecting half vertically toward detector A and transmitting half \\ntoward detector B. a photon however represents a single quantised energy state (E=hn) \\nand hence cannot be split, so it is detected with equal probability at either A or B. this is \\nverified by observation that if the detector A registers the signal than B does not and vice-\\nversa. With this piece of information one would like to think that any given photon \\ntravels either vertically or horizontally, randomly choosing between the two paths. \\nQuantum mechanics however predicts that the photon actually travels both paths \\nsimultaneously, collapsing down to one path only upon measurement (collapse of the \\nwave function). This effect is known as single-particle interference resulting from the \\nlinear superposition of the possible photon states of potential paths. The phenomenon of \\nsingle particle interference can be better illustrated in a slightly more elaborate \\nexperiment, outlined in fig 3. In this experiment the photon first encounters a half \\npolished mirror (beam splitter) thus getting split into two parts: reflected beam and \\ntransmitted beam. The two beams are recombined with the half of the fully silvered \\nmirrors and finally another half silvered mirror splits before reaching a detector. Each \\nhalf silvered mirror introduces the probability of the photon following down one path or \\nthe other. Once a photon strikes the mirror along either of two paths after the first beam \\nsplitter, the arrangement is identical to that in fig 2 thus a single photon travelling \\nvertically, when strikes the mirror, then by the experiment in fig 2, there should be an \\nequal probability (50%) that the photon will strike either detector A or detector B. the \\nsame goes for a photon travelling down the horizontal path. However, the actual result is \\ndrastically different. If the two possible paths are exactly equal in length, then it turns out \\nthat there is 100% probability that photon reaches the detector A & 0% probability that it \\nreaches the detector B thus the photon is certain to strike the detector A it seems \\ninescapable that the photon must, in some sense, have actually travelled both routes \\nsimultaneously.

Thus there is a direct correlation \\nbetween the state of gun and the state of the teller ‘gun fired’ means “ teller alive” . In the \\nevent it is presumed the robber only shots to kill and he never misses. \\n \\n        In the world of microscopic objects described by quantum mechanics, correlation \\namong the events is not so simple.

However, in the quantum \\nmechanical world, it is also possible for the atom to be in a combined state decayed-not \\ndecayed in which it is neither one nor the other but somewhere in between. This is due to \\nthe principle of linear superposition of two quantum mechanical states of the atom, and is \\nnot something we normally expect of classical objects like guns or tellers. Further let us \\nconsider a system consisting of two nuclei. Two nuclei may be correlated so that if one \\nhas decayed, the other will also have decayed. And if one has not decayed, neither has the \\nother. This is 100% correlation. However, the nuclei may also be correlated so that if one \\nis in the superposition state, ‘decayed-not decayed’, the other will also be. Thus quantum \\nmechanically, then one more correlation between nuclei than we would expect \\nclassically. This kind of quantum ‘super correlation’ is called ‘Entanglement’. \\n \\n           Entanglement was in fact originally named German, ‘Verschrankung’, by Erwin \\nSchrodinger, a Nobel laureate in physics, for his basic contribution in quantum \\nmechanics. Schrodinger was the first to realize the strange character of entanglement. \\nImagine it is not the robber but the nucleus, which determines whether the gun fires. If \\nthe nucleus decays, it sets off a hair trigger, which fires the gun.  If it does not decay, the \\ngun does not fire. But if the nucleus is in the superposition it can be correlated to the gun \\nin a superposition state fired-not fired. However such a correlation leads to a catastrophic \\nsituation. In the present case teller is dead or alive at the same time! Schrodinger was \\nworried about the similar situation where the victim of the quantum entanglement was a \\ncat in a box (Schrodinger cat: A paradox). For Schrodinger cat in a box decay nucleus \\ncould trigger the release of lethal chemical. The basic problem is that in the everyday \\nworld we are not used to see anything like dead-alive cat or dead-alive teller. However, in \\nprinciple, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory describing every level of our \\nexperience, such strange states should be possible. Where does the quantum world stop \\nand the classical world begins? Do we really have an interface separating quantum \\nphenomenon from the classical one? And so on. These and allied problems have been \\ndescribed since long and in the process a number of different interpretations of quantum \\ntheory have been suggested.  \\n           \\n             The problem was brought into focus by a famous paper in 1935 by Einstein, \\nPodolsky and Rosen, who argued that the strange behaviour of entanglement that \\nquantum mechanics is an incomplete theory not wrong. This is widely known as EPR \\nparadox. The concept of EPR paradox can be understood with the help of following \\nexample: consider a Helium atom in the ground state. It has two electrons having \\nfollowing quantum numbers: n=1, l=0, s=1/2, sz = +1/2 for one and sz = -1/2 for another. \\nThus we have j = 0 & 1. But jz = (sz )1 + (sz )2 = 0. Hence only j=0 state is allowed. Thus \\nin a Helium atom, two electrons are antiparallel to each other and hence form entangled \\npair of system. The atom is provided sufficient energy (equal to the binding energy of the \\natom). So that it disintegrates at rest. Consequently two electrons fly away in opposite \\ndirection.

A simple scenario may be invoked: at the first step of conception of the \\nembryo, a genetic process which is random in nature, produced a pair of chromosome \\nsequence-one which is responsible for the occurrence or absence of the disease that has \\nbeen duplicated and given to both brothers. \\n        \\n         Thus the two situations the case of correlation between the polarized states of two \\nphotons and the case of twin brothers (a number of such situations can be exemplified) \\nare exactly analogous. It seems therefore, natural to link this correlation between the pairs \\nof photons to some common property analogous to the common genome of the two twin \\nbrothers. This common property changes form pair to pair, which accounts for the \\nrandom character of the single event. This is the basic conclusion drawn by John Bell \\nregarding EPR states. A natural generalization of the EPR reasoning leads to the \\nconclusion that quantum mechanics is not a complete description of physical reality. As a \\nmatter of fact, introduction of “ some common property”  which changes from pair to pair, \\ninvokes the idea that complete description of a pair must include “ something”  in addition \\nto the state vector, which is the same for all pairs. This “ something”  can be called \\nsupplementary parameter or hidden variables. Inclusion of hidden variables sends an \\naccount of the polarized states of two photons, for any set (a, b) of orientations. \\n \\n2.5.2.2 Bell Inequalities \\n \\n      Bell examined critically the requirement for hidden variables to explain the expected \\ncorrelation between the two polarized states of photons. It was shown that the expected \\ncorrelations, for the joint measurements of polarized states of photons as mentioned \\nabove, cannot take any set of values, but they are subjected to certain constraints. More \\nprecisely, if we consider four possible sets of orientations [(a.b), (a.b’), (a’.b), (a’.b’)], \\nthe corresponding correlation coefficients (which measure the amount of correlation) are \\nrestricted by Bell inequalities which states that a given combination of these four \\ncoefficients ‘s’ is between – 2 and +2 for any reasonable hidden variable theory. Thus \\nBell inequalities prescribe a test for the validity of hidden variable theory. However, \\nquantum mechanics predicts the value of s as 2.8 i.e., it violates Bell inequalities, and the \\nsame is tested by experiments. Thus the hidden variable theories envisaged above are \\nunable to send an account of the EPR correlation (quantum entanglement) predicted by \\nquantum mechanics. As a matter of fact quantum mechanical correlations are more \\nintricate to understand as compared to mutual correlations between twin brothers. \\n           \\n           Bell inequality is based on the assumption of local hidden variable models. The \\nassumption of locality states that the result of a measurement by a polariser cannot be \\ndirectly influenced by the choice of the orientation of the other remotely located \\npolariser. Actually this is nothing but the consequence of Einstein causality (No signal \\ncan move with a speed greater than speed of light in vacuum).

In the last few years there has been an explosion of theoretical and experimental \\ninnovations leading to the creation of a fundamental new discipline: a distinctly Quantum \\nTheory of Information. Quantum physics allows the construction of qualitatively new \\ntypes of logic gates, absolutely secure cryptosystems (systems that combine \\ncommunications and cryptography), the cramming of two bits of information into one \\nphysical bit and, has far just been proposed, a son of “ teleportation” . \\n \\n      Until recently teleportation was not taken seriously by scientists. Usually \\nteleportation is the name given by science fiction writers to the feat of making an object \\nor person disintegrate in one place while a perfect replica appears somewhere else. \\nNormally this is done by scanning the object in such a way as to extract all the \\ninformation from it, then this information is transmitted to the information from it, then \\nthis information is transmitted to the receiving location and used to construct the replica, \\nnot necessarily from the actual material of the original, but probably from atoms of the \\nsame kinds, arranged in exactly the same pattern as the original. A teleportation machine \\nwould be like a fax machine, except that it would work on 3-dimensional objects as well \\nas documents, it would produce an exact copy rather an approximate facsimile and it \\nwould destroy the original in the process of scanning it. \\n \\n     In classical physics, an object can be teleported, in principle by performing a \\nmeasurement to completely characterize the properties of the object that information can \\nthen be sent to another location, and this object reconstructed. Moreover classical \\ninformation theory agrees with everyday intuition: if a message is to be sent using an \\nobject which can be put into one of N distinguishable states, the maximum number of \\ndifferent messages which can be sent is N. For example, single photon can have only two \\ndistinguishable polarization states: left handed and right handed. Thus a single photon \\ncan not transmit more than two distinguishable messages i.e. one bit of information. \\nNotwithstanding the basic question: is it possible to provide a complete reconstruction of \\nthe original object? The answer is no. All the physical systems are ultimately quantum \\nmechanical and quantum mechanics tells us that it is impossible to completely determine \\nthe state of an unknown quantum system, making it impossible to use the classical \\nmeasurement procedure to move a quantum system from one location to another. This is \\ndue to Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle which states that more accurately an object is \\nscanned, the more it is disturbed by the scanning process, until one reaches a point where \\nthe objects original state has been completely disrupted, still without having extracted \\nenough information to make a perfect replica.

Analogous to any physical system, the \\nmodern computers based on digital devices produce heat in operation. The basic question \\nis: Can digital computers be improved so as to minimize production of heat. It turns out \\nthat it is possible to think (consistent with the laws of physics) of an ideal computer \\ncapable of shaping, maintaining and moving around digital signals, maintaining and \\nmoving around digital signals without any heat generation. Nevertheless there is one \\nplace where heat must be produced. Whenever information is erased the phase space \\nassociated with the system that stores information shrinks. Erasing a single bit of \\ninformation reduces entropy of the system that stored that information by at least \\nDS=klog2. This reduction of entropy results in heat transfer to the environment. \\n       \\n     Thus if a computer could be constructed that does not erase any information, such a \\ncomputer could work without generating any heat at all. This is precisely the situation in \\nquantum computers. Quantum Computation is reversible (but not the read out of the \\nresult of that computation). It is therefore possible, at least in principle, to carryout \\nquantum computation without generating heat. Of course, in reality the computer would \\nstill generate a lot of heat. Electric pulses moving along copper wires would have to work \\ntheir way against resistance. Electrons diffusing from a source would still collide with \\ncrystal imperfections and with electrons in the drain again, generating heat. But at least in \\nideal situation, copper wires could be replaced with superconductors, imperfect crystals \\nwith prefect ones. \\n \\n     The reversibility of quantum computers is being realised by conceiving and \\nfabricating special gates. In digital computers gate like NOR, AND, NAND and XOR are \\nemployed. All these gates are irreversible: they must generate heat. Amount of \\ninformation on the right hand side of \\n \\n     (a,b)        (aÙb) \\n \\nis less  than the amount of information on the left hand side. Using Toffoli gates Charles \\nBennett has demonstrated that quantum computers are capable of performing any \\ncomputation utilizing only reversible steps. These special gates maintain all information \\nthat is passed to them, so that the computation can be run forward and backward. \\nConsequently the computation results in a very large amount of data, because every \\nintermediate step is remembered, but heat generation is eliminated which the computation \\ngoes on. After the computation is over the computation can be run backwards in order to \\nrestore the initial state of the computer and avoid its spontaneous combustion. \\n \\n2.8 Experimental Realisation of Quantum Computer \\n \\n       The architectural simplicity makes the quantum computer faster, smaller and cheaper \\nbut its conceptual intricacies are posing difficult problems for its experimental \\nrealization.

It is envisaged that it may not be too far when the quantum \\ncomputer would replace digital computer with its full prospects. Some of the attempts for \\nthe experimental realization of quantum computer are summarized as follows: \\n \\n2.8.1 Heteropolymers: \\n        \\n      The first heteropolymer based quantum computer was designed and built in 1988 by \\nTeich and then improved by Lloyd in 1993. In a heteropolymer computer a linear array of \\natoms is used as memory cells. Information is stored on a cell by pumping the \\ncorresponding atom into an excited state. Instructions are transmitted to the \\nheteropolymer by laser pulses of appropriately tuned frequencies. The nature of the \\ncomputation that is performed on selected atoms is determined by the shape and the \\nduration of the pulse. \\n    \\n2.8.2 Ion Traps: \\n \\n  An ion trap quantum computer was first proposed by Cirac and Zoller in 1995 and \\nimplemented first by Monroe and collaborators in 1995 and then by Schwarzchild in \\n1996. The ion trap computer encodes data in energy states of ions and in vibrational \\nmodes between the ions. Conceptually each ion is operated by a separate laser. A \\npreliminary analysis demonstrated that Fourier transforms can be evaluated with the \\nion trap computer. This, in turn, leads to Shor’s factoring algorithm, which is based \\non Fourier transforms. \\n \\n \\n2.8.3 Quantum Electrodynamics Cavity: \\n \\n     A quantum electrodynamics (QED) cavity computer was demonstrated by \\nTurchette and collaborators in 1995. The computer consists of a QED cavity filled \\nwith some cesium atoms and an arrangement of lasers, phase shift detectors, polarizer \\nand mirrors. The setup is a true quantum computer because it can create, manipulate \\nand preserve superposition and entanglements. \\n \\n2.8.4 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance: \\n \\n     A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) computer consists of a capsule filled with \\na liquid and an NMR machine. Each molecule in the liquid is an independent \\nquantum memory register. Computation proceeds by sending radio pulses to the \\nsample and reading its response. Qubits are implemented as spin states of the nuclei \\nof atoms comprising the molecules. In an NMR computer the readout of the memory \\nregister is accomplished by a measurement performed on a statistical ensemble of \\nsay, 2.7x1019 molecules. This is in contrast to QED cavity computer ion-trap \\ncomputer, in which a single isolated quantum system was used for memory register. \\nNMR computer can solve NP (Non-polynomial) complete problems in polynomial \\ntime.

An array of quantum dots, in \\nwhich the dots are connected with their nearest neighbors by the means of gated \\ntunneling barriers are used for fabricating quantum gates using split gate technique. This \\nscheme has one of the basic advantages: the qubits are controlled electrically. The \\ndisadvantage of this architecture is that quantum dots can communicate with their nearest \\nneighbors only resulting data read out is quite difficult. \\n \\n2.8.5.1 Josephson Junctions \\n \\n      The Josephson junction quantum computer was demonstrated in 1999 by Nakamura \\nand the coworkers. In this computer a Cooper pair box, which is a small superconducting \\nisland electrode is weakly coupled to a bulk superconductor. Weak coupling between the \\nsuperconductors create a Josephson junction between them which behaves as a capacitor. \\nIf the Cooper box is small as a quantum dot, the charging current breaks into discrete \\ntransfer of individual Cooper pairs, so that ultimately it is possible to just transfer a single \\nCooper pair across the junction. Like quantum dot, computers in Josephson junction \\ncomputers, qubits are controlled electrically. Josephson junction’s quantum computers \\nare one of the promising  candidates for future developments. \\n \\n2.8.5.2 The Kane Computer \\n       \\n       This computer looks a little like a quantum dot computer but in other ways it is more \\nlike an NMR computer. It consists of a single magnetically active nucleus of p31 in a \\ncrystal of isotropically clean magnetically inactive Si28. The sample is then placed in a \\nvery strong magnetic field in order to set the spin of p31 parallel or antiparallel with the \\ndirection of the field. The spin of the p31 nucleus can then be manipulated by applying a \\nradio frequency pulse to a control electrode, called A-gate, adjacent to the nucleus. \\nElectron mediated interaction between spins could in turn be manipulated by applying \\nvoltage to electrodes called J-gates, placed between the p31 nuclei.  \\n \\n2.8.6 Topological Quantum Computer  \\n \\n        In this computer qubits are encoded in a system of anyons. “ Anyons”  are quasi-\\nparticles in 2-dimensional media obeying parastatistics (neither Fermi Dirac nor Bose \\nEinstein). But in a way anyons are still closer to fermions, because a fermion like \\nrepulsion exists between them. The respective movement of anyons is described by braid \\ngroup. The idea behind the topological quantum computer is to make use of the braid \\ngroup properties that describe the motion of anyons in order to carry out quantum \\ncomputations. It is claimed that such a computer should be invulnerable to quantum \\nerrors of the topological stability of anyons. \\n \\n \\n ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

That covers \\nquantum algorithms, understanding dynamics and control of decoherence, atomic scale \\ntechnology and worthwhile applications. Reversibility of quantum computation may help \\nin solving NP problems, which are easy in one direction but hard in the opposite sense. \\nGlobal minimization problems may benefit from interference (as seen in Fermat’s \\nprinciple in wave mechanics). Simulated annealing methods may improve due to \\nquantum tunneling through barriers. Powerful properties of complex numbers(analytic \\nfunctions, conformal mappings) may provide new algorithms. \\n \\n   Quantum field theory can extend quantum computation to allow for creation and \\ndestruction of quanta. The natural setting for such operations is in quantum optics. For \\nexample, the traditional double slit experiment (or beam splitter) can be viewed as the \\ncopy operation. It is permitted in quantum theory because the intensity of the two copies \\nis half the previous value. Theoretical tools for handling many-body quantum \\nentanglement are not well developed. Its improved characterization may produce better \\nimplementation of quantum logic gates and possibilities to correct correlated errors. \\n \\n    Though decoherence can be described as an effective process, its dynamics is not \\nunderstood. To be able to control decoherence, one should be able to figure out the eigen \\nstates favored by the environment in a given setup. The dynamics of measurement \\nprocess is not understood either, even after several decades of quantum mechanics. \\nMeasurement is just described as a non-unitary projection operator in an otherwise \\nunitary quantum theory. Ultimately both the system and the observer are made up of \\nquantum building blocks, and a unified quantum description of both measurement and \\ndecoherence must be developed. Apart from theoretical gain, it would help in improving \\nthe detectors that operate close to the quantum limit of observation. For physicist, it is of \\ngreat interest to study the transition from classical to quantum regime. Enlargement of the \\nsystem from microscopic to mesoscopic levels, and reduction of the environment from \\nmacroscopic to mesoscopic levels, can take us there. If there is something beyond \\nquantum theory lurking there, it would be noticed in the struggle for making quantum \\ndevices. We may discover new limitations of quantum theory in trying to conquer \\ndecoherence. \\n \\n     Theoretical developments alone will be no good without a matching technology. \\nNowadays, the race for miniaturization of electronic circuits is not far away from the \\nquantum reality of nature. To devise new types of instruments we must change our view-\\npoint from scientific to technological-quantum effects are not for only observation, we \\nshould learn to control them from practical use.

For mixed entangled states in a Quantum System i.e. 0< Corr. < 1, in such type of \\nsystems wave function is given by: \\n \\n       y = d + S an yn & S |an|2 ¹ 1 where n e allowed un-correlated states & y(n) are Eigen \\nstates. In such a case since entangled and unentangled states cannot be separated as that \\nwould amount to an interaction with the system leading to information loss and wave \\nfunction collapse.

Does the notion of quantum of action h (h, 2h, 3h… ) lead to irreversibility in the \\nmeasurement process since ½ h or any fraction value of h cannot take place? \\n2. Irreversibility is brought in due to entropy change in the system, since entropy is a \\nstatistical phenomenon, does this anyway relate to statistical behaviour of \\nquantum probabilities? \\n3. Is irreversibility in a Quantum measurement more fundamental that uncertainty in \\nthe measurement process and leads to uncertainty in the system, thus explaining \\nthe need for Uncertainty Principle? \\nThus in Classical Mechanics entropy (S) of a system is associated with the loss of \\ninformation in the system due to the energy interaction and 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. \\nBut in Quantum Mechanics we have the concept of choice of information due to wave \\nfunction collapse, so we can define a new parameter analogous to entropy in case of \\nQuantum systems related to the choice of information. Thus we introduce here a \\npossibility of the need of a new parameter for depicting the concept of choice of \\ninformation analogous to entropy.

The scientist wrote about the potential for nanoscience in an \\ninfluential 1959 talk “ There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.”  thus ushering a new \\nera of the field of low dimensional materials. One thing common about all the \\nconducting nanomaterials is that, in spite of the contraction in the size of the material, \\nthe basic characteristics of the material remains the same- the energy levels remain \\nthe same. This fact remains true as long as the size of the material undergoes \\nnoticeable change. The number of energy levels increases and they start shifting \\ntowards ‘blue’ region. By this, it is meant that the wavelength is smaller than green, \\nyellow, orange and red. But with the decrease in wavelength, the frequency increases. \\n \\nNow we know that the energy level E is given by the equation: \\n \\n                       E = h n where h: Planck’s constant and n is frequency. \\n \\nAs the frequency increases by shifting towards blue, the energy increases. Therefore, \\nthese materials are capable of storing more energy and are said to exhibit \\nnanoproperty. The cause of the above said phenomena is stated below: \\n \\nThere is a wavelength called Compton Wavelength, which decides at which energy \\nlevels of the materials change. \\n \\nlc = h/ (m0 * c) \\nh: Planck’s constant \\nm0: rest mass \\nc: velocity of light. \\n \\nIf the size of any material is comparable with its Compton’s wavelength, it exhibits \\nnanoproperty and the materials are called Nanomaterial. This is found to be the order \\n10-9 m. This is the reason why these materials exhibit nanoproperty. Thus, we come \\nto the conclusion that as we move from macro to nano dimensions, we observe the \\nfollowing: \\n \\n1. There is an additional constraint in the movement of electrons and protons. \\n2. There is reduction in the degree of freedom. \\n \\nTherefore, these materials are also called as materials of low dimensionality, in which \\nthe charge density increases by decreasing the degree of freedom.

Effective reduction of geometry to two or fewer dimensional systems is \\npossible by a strong spatial localisation to a plane, line or point( i.e. confinement of an \\nelectron in at least one direction at the de-Broglie wavelength) occurs only in the case of \\natoms and electrons localised on crystal imperfections( e.g. on impurities).  \\n \\nQuantum Wells are one of the three basic components of quantum devices, which are \\nultra thin, quasi 3-D planes.

All these problems are still present in the quantum \\nversion of the theory and appear in an even more complicated manner. In the last ten \\ndecades, even since Lorentz identified the problem in 1903, a number of attempts have \\nbeen made to circumvent divergence problem of Classical Electrodynamics. Out of all \\nthe prescriptions, the renormalization technique and Rohrlich procedure of invoking \\nboundary conditions have drawn special attention. During the course of present \\ninvestigation, I am bringing to the forefront an attempt which has been made to \\nreformulate the theory of electricity and magnetism. In the process, a simple but an \\nelegant prescription proposed by Prof. Y M Gupta has been used. For the development of \\nproposed formalism a stand has been taken that the problem as enunciated above must be \\nsolved initially at the classical level and only then the reformulation be carried forward to \\nthe quantum level. This procedural development automatically ensures the basic stringent \\nrequirement that the future theory must be a covering theory of the present one: invoking \\nBohr Correspondence Principle- “ In the limit when the proposed modification is \\nwithdrawn, the proposed theory reduces to the existing one.”  \\n \\nThe proposed formalism is based on the observation that in the realm of known \\nformalism of Classical Electrodynamics potential function, field intensity, field \\nmomentum and interaction force, all, are singular at the origin(R=0) i.e. all these physical \\nquantities become infinite in the limit of zero distance. It is this singularity, which is the \\ncrux of the problem. In the present formalism we choose a potential function such that it \\nis suitably and correctly chosen such that it is regular at the origin as well as all other \\nspace points, we automatically get physical quantities free from singularity. This is a \\nlogical way to obtain a whole set of dependent quantities which are regular ab initio. But \\nat the same time it is also clear that all attempts at changing the basic equations of \\nElectrodynamics (Maxwell equations) have proved unsuccessful. As a matter of fact, it is \\nrequired to keep the basic equations of electrodynamics intact and yet look for a suitable \\npotential function (solution of basic equations) that provides divergence-free solutions to \\nthe problems of Classical Electrodynamics (field energy, field intensity, field momentum \\netc.). To achieve this objective, prescriptions proposed by Prof. Y M Gupta have been \\nfollowed. The important features of the prescriptions are- \\n \\n1. The basic equations of Electrodynamics (Maxwell equations) remain intact. \\n2. The form of potential function, as obtained, is such that it is regular at all \\nspace points including origin. Notwithstanding this, it also gives rise to field \\nintensities, field energies and interaction forces that are regular at all space \\npoints ab initio. \\n3. No free parameter is introduced into the theory- it is basically a parameter free \\ntheory. \\n4. The prescription very gently obeys Bohr Correspondence Principle. In other \\nwords, in the limit of large distances the proposed potential function reduces \\nto usual Coulomb potential function. \\n5. The prescription is quite general in nature and not restricted to \\nelectrodynamics alone. Indeed, it can be applied to any inverse square force \\nlaw. (E.g. Newtonian gravitational force and Yukawa Nuclear force.) \\n \\nWhen the whole problem is analysed very closely, it is observed that the crux of the \\nproblem in hidden in the fact that in the realm of known formalism of classical ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It is a very general term \\nwith regard to physical systems. There are various symmetries in Nature like local space \\ntime symmetries and global space time symmetries. Global space time symmetries apply \\nto all the laws of Physics. Here in this section we will attempt to give a direction on \\nwhich a further thought can be developed for the resolution of the famous Measurement \\nProblem in Quantum Mechanics. It is the Measurement Problem which lies at the heart of \\nvarious problems and observation anomalies in Quantum Mechanics. Here I am trying to \\ngive an explanation of Measurement Problem using Symmetry breaking process. The \\nbasic equation of Quantum Mechanics i.e. AB ¹ BA valid for conjugate variables shows \\nsome kind of irreversibility in the system. Now by the Leibniz’s Principle of Sufficient \\nReason (PSR): If there is no sufficient reason for one thing to happen instead of another, \\nthe principle says that nothing happens or in a situation with certain symmetry evolves in \\nsuch a way that, in the absence of an asymmetric cause, the initial symmetry is preserved. \\nIn other words, a breaking of initial symmetry cannot happen without a reason or an \\nasymmetry cannot originate spontaneously. Asymmetry is what creates a phenomenon. \\nThus symmetry breaking follows Principle of Causality that is “ For every effect there is a \\ncause.”  By the Measurement process we purposefully throw the Quantum System as a \\n“ choice of information”  by the observer unlike the collapsing of the wave function into \\nan uncertain Eigen state. Thus in a Measurement process the system does not lose \\ninformation like classical systems but is thrown in a particular eigen state based on the \\ninformation choice made by the observer. Hence we need to introduce a parameter in \\nQuantum Mechanics which takes care of this “ choice of information”  rather the “ loss of \\ninformation”  whose parameter is entropy in classical mechanics. Curie’s Principle also is \\nan interesting way to represent symmetry requirements in a system. The symmetry \\nelements of the causes must be found in their effects, but the converse is not true, that is \\nthe effects can be more symmetric then their causes. Conditions valid for Curie’s \\nPrinciple are: \\n1. The causal connection must be valid. \\n2. Cause and Effect and their respective symmetries must be well defined. \\nThe there must be a sufficient reason for the Measurement Problem to occur and by the \\nLeibniz’s Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) we can conclude that there must be some \\nsymmetry breaking phenomenon occurring as a reason for the asymmetry in the system \\nand thus leading to Measurement Problem. Thus it is a matter of further research to find \\nthe precise way how symmetry breaks in the system? What type of symmetry exists? Is it \\na local or a global symmetry which breaks in the Reduction(R) Process of the wave \\nfunction as it is called in the Quantum Mechanics parlance? Thus introducing symmetry \\nin the Reduction Process in Quantum Mechanics is a novel idea and can put some more \\nlight into the reason and the precise process by which wave function collapse occurs. \\nThus this may fundamentally give the reason of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

In the form of Schrodinger Time Dependent Wave Eq. \\n                                         ih/2pppp (¶¶¶¶/¶¶¶¶t) yyyy = H yyyy   \\nWe can introduce the correlation effect in the modification of the Hamiltonian (H) of \\nthe system by introducing a potential term in the expression of H of the system and \\nkeeping wave function (y) as it is defined by the Expansion Theorem. \\n2. In the second case we can keep Hamiltonian (H) as it is and change the definition \\nof wave function (y) by introducing a d term to account for correlation effect of \\nEPR states. \\nHence we have attempted the second case in our formalism of accounting for correlation \\nin the definition of wave function (y) of the system. Though both the approaches are new \\nto the scene and have not been attempted for this type of a situation. Hence the \\napplication of first case is an area of further research in this formalism. \\n Eigen states are essentially entangled or correlated in an EPR situation and since EPR \\nimplies non-local communication and apparent breakdown of Heisenberg Uncertainty \\nPrinciple hence it may lead to the modification of Linear Superposition Principle’s \\nlinearity gets violated and different eigen states start interfering with each other and lead \\nto the introduction of d in the definition of wave function (y). \\n \\nEPR states              modification of Linear Superposition Principle             new definition \\nof wave function (y) or introduction of a new parameter altogether. \\n \\nWe find from the above two possible scenarios that EPR correlation can be incorporated \\nin the Schrodinger time dependent wave Eq. by modifying the Hamiltonian and \\nintroducing the d term due to correlation i e. The word eq. can be written as: \\n \\nHamiltonian = Kinetic energy term + Potential energy + energy due to EPR \\ncorrelation \\n \\nThus this can be one of the attempted explanations for introducing correlation in the \\nscene. In the second case we can put the Hamiltonian as it is without “ energy due to EPR \\ncorrelation”  term and can rather modify the wave function (y) in a non-linear way by \\nintroducing the d term and accounting for EPR correlation as it has already been done in \\nprevious sections. \\n \\n5.3 Possibility of third paradigm in Quantum Mechanics \\n \\n     It is a well known fact that though Quantum Mechanics gives correct mathematical \\nresults of quantum phenomena but the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is very \\npeculiar and is still not complete till date because of paradoxes like Schrodinger Cat \\nparadox and Einstein Podolsky Rosen (EPR) Paradox, Wave Function Collapse and ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In this we attempt to give a new direction of thinking for a new \\nformulation of the fundamental principle of Uncertainty in Quantum Mechanics since all \\npeculiarities of Quantum Mechanics are derived from the Uncertainty Principle. We \\ndescribe the two mechanics we know of and predict the possibility of the third one: \\n \\n1. In Classical Mechanics the fundamental concept is the concept of Determinism \\nwhich says that given a state of the system at one point of time the state of the system at \\nsome later time can be predict with 100% accuracy. This can be reformulated in a \\nstatement including dynamical variables position (x) and momentum (p) as  \\n       “ Both position (x) & momentum (p) can be measured to any desired accuracy.”  \\n \\n2. In Quantum Mechanics we have the fundamental Uncertainty Principle given by: \\n          \\n             Dx.Dp >= h/2p \\n     It is interpreted as “  Either position (x) or momentum (p) can be measured with \\ndesired accuracy but not both at the same time.”  \\n \\n3. Here we give a new line of thinking to the above formalisms by saying that: \\n \\n“ Neither position (x) nor momentum (p) to any degree of accuracy can be \\nmeasured.”   \\n \\n This is a very interesting statement since in case 1 above we have determinism in the \\ndefinition of the system. In case 2 we have probability but still it is limited probability \\nsince one of the parameters can still be measured to desired degree of accuracy. But in \\ncase 3 we have brought in a complete indeterminism in which both the variables are \\ncompletely indeterministic. This formalism requires a new definition of Schrodinger \\nWave Eq., Uncertainty Principle etc. It may be possible that Quantum Mechanics is a \\nspecial case of this third mechanics as we move from complete indeterminism to limited \\nindeterminism (Quantum Mechanics) to complete determinism (Classical Mechanics). \\nThis concept of complete indeterminism may be related in some way to Consciousness of \\nthe observer which is hot area of research in Quantum Mechanics these days. This last \\nproposal was given by Stephen Hawking as a new direction of thinking on the \\nmodification of Quantum Mechanics right at the fundamental level. \\n \\n5.4 Conclusion and Future Scope \\n \\nThe foundations of the subject of quantum computation have become well established, \\nbut everything else required for its future growth is under exploration. That covers \\nquantum algorithms, logic gate operations, error correction, understanding dynamics and \\ncontrol of decoherence, atomic scale technology and worthwhile applications. \\nReversibility of quantum computation may help in solving NP problems, which are easy \\nin one direction but hard in the opposite sense. Global minimization problems may \\nbenefit from interference effects (as seen in Fermat’s principle in wave mechanics). \\nSimulated annealing methods may improve due to quantum tunneling through barriers. \\nPowerful properties of complex numbers (analytic functions, conformal mappings) may \\nprovide new algorithms. Theoretical tools for handling many-body quantum \\nentanglement are not well developed.

The \\ndynamics of measurement process in not understood fully, though the attempt is also \\nmade in this regard in this project. Measurement is just described as a non-unitary \\nprojection operator in an otherwise unitary quantum theory.

Aristotle believed that objects have an essence that explains their behavior, and a theory of the natural world has to refer to the reasons (or “final cause” to use Aristotle’s language) as to why they exhibit certain phenomena. Democritus believed in a purely mechanistic explanation of the world. In his view, the universe was ultimately composed of elementary particles (or Atoms) and our observed phenomena arise from the interactions between these particles according to some local rules. Modern science (arguably starting with Newton) has embraced Democritus’ point of view, of a mechanistic or “clockwork” universe of particles and forces acting upon them.\\n\\nWhile the classification of particles and forces evolved with time, to a large extent the “big picture” has not changed from Newton till Einstein. In particular it was held as an axiom that if we knew fully the current state of the universe (i.e., the particles and their properties such as location and velocity) then we could predict its future state at any point in time. In computational language, in all these theories the state of a system with  particles could be stored in an array of  numbers, and predicting the evolution of the system can be done by running some efficient (e.g.,  time) deterministic computation on this array.\\n\\nThe double slit experiment\\n\\nAlas, in the beginning of the 20th century, several experimental results were calling into question this “clockwork” or “billiard ball” theory of the world. One such experiment is the famous double slit experiment. Here is one way to describe it. Suppose that we buy one of those baseball pitching machines, and aim it at a soft plastic wall, but put a metal barrier with a single slit between the machine and the plastic wall (see doublebaseballfig). If we shoot baseballs at the plastic wall, then some of the baseballs would bounce off the metal barrier, while some would make it through the slit and dent the wall. If we now carve out an additional slit in the metal barrier then more balls would get through, and so the plastic wall would be even more dented.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the “double baseball experiment” we shoot baseballs from a gun at a soft wall through a hard barrier that has one or two slits open in it. There is only “constructive interference” in the sense that the dent in each position in the wall when both slits are open is the sum of the dents when each slit is open on its own.\\n\\nSo far this is pure common sense, and it is indeed (to my knowledge) an accurate description of what happens when we shoot baseballs at a plastic wall. However, this is not the same when we shoot photons. Amazingly, if we shoot with a “photon gun” (i.e., a laser) at a wall equipped with photon detectors through some barrier, then (as shown in doubleslitfig) in some positions of the wall we will see fewer hits when the two slits are open than when only one of them is. In particular there are positions in the wall that are hit when the first slit is open, hit when the second slit is open, but are not hit at all when both slits are open!\\n\\nThe setup of the double slit experiment in the case of photon or electron guns. We see also destructive interference in the sense that there are some positions on the wall that get fewer hits when both slits are open than they get when only one of the slits is open.

We see also destructive interference in the sense that there are some positions on the wall that get fewer hits when both slits are open than they get when only one of the slits is open. Image credit: Wikipedia.\\n\\nIt seems as if each photon coming out of the gun is aware of the global setup of the experiment, and behaves differently if two slits are open than if only one is. If we try to “catch the photon in the act” and place a detector right next to each slit so we can see exactly the path each photon takes then something even more bizarre happens. The mere fact that we measure the path changes the photon’s behavior, and now this “destructive interference” pattern is gone and the number of times a position is hit when two slits are open is the sum of the number of times it is hit when each slit is open.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou should read the paragraphs above more than once and make sure you appreciate how truly mind boggling these results are.\\n\\nQuantum amplitudes\\n\\nThe double slit and other experiments ultimately forced scientists to accept a very counterintuitive picture of the world. It is not merely about nature being randomized, but rather it is about the probabilities in some sense “going negative” and cancelling each other!\\n\\nTo see what we mean by this, let us go back to the baseball experiment. Suppose that the probability a ball passes through the left slit is  and the probability that it passes through the right slit is . Then, if we shoot  balls out of each gun, we expect the wall will be hit  times. In contrast, in the quantum world of photons instead of baseballs, it can sometimes be the case that in both the first and second case the wall is hit with positive probabilities  and  respectively but somehow when both slits are open the wall (or a particular position in it) is not hit at all. It’s almost as if the probabilities can “cancel each other out”.\\n\\nTo understand the way we model this in quantum mechanics, it is helpful to think of a “lazy evaluation” approach to probability. We can think of a probabilistic experiment such as shooting a baseball through two slits in two different ways:\\n\\nWhen a ball is shot, “nature” tosses a coin and decides if it will go through the left slit (which happens with probability ), right slit (which happens with probability ), or bounce back. If it passes through one of the slits then it will hit the wall. Later we can look at the wall and find out whether or not this event happened, but the fact that the event happened or not is determined independently of whether or not we look at the wall.\\n\\nThe other viewpoint is that when a ball is shot, “nature” computes the probabilities  and  as before, but does not yet “toss the coin” and determines what happened. Only when we actually look at the wall, nature tosses a coin and with probability  ensures we see a dent. That is, nature uses “lazy evaluation”, and only determines the result of a probabilistic experiment when we decide to measure it.\\n\\nWhile the first scenario seems much more natural, the end result in both is the same (the wall is hit with probability ) and so the question of whether we should model nature as following the first scenario or second one seems like asking about the proverbial tree that falls in the forest with no one hearing it.\\n\\nHowever, when we want to describe the double slit experiment with photons rather than baseballs, it is the second scenario that lends itself better to a quantum generalization. Quantum mechanics associates a number  known as an amplitude with each probabilistic experiment. This number  can be negative, and in fact even complex. We never observe the amplitudes directly, since whenever we measure an event with amplitude , nature tosses a coin and determines that the event happens with probability . However, the sign (or in the complex case, phase) of the amplitudes can affect whether two different events have constructive or destructive interference.\\n\\nSpecifically, consider an event that can either occur or not (e.g.\\xa0“detector number 17 was hit by a photon”). In classical probability, we model this by a probability distribution over the two outcomes: a pair of non-negative numbers  and  such that , where  corresponds to the probability that the event occurs and  corresponds to the probability that the event does not occur. In quantum mechanics, we model this also by pair of numbers, which we call amplitudes. This is a pair of (potentially negative or even complex) numbers  and  such that . The probability that the event occurs is  and the probability that it does not occur is . In isolation, these negative or complex numbers don’t matter much, since we square them anyway to obtain probabilities. But the interaction of positive and negative amplitudes can result in surprising cancellations where somehow combining two scenarios where an event happens with positive probability results in a scenario where it never does.\\n\\nIf you don’t find the above description confusing and unintuitive, you probably didn’t get it. Please make sure to re-read the above paragraphs until you are thoroughly confused.\\n\\nQuantum mechanics is a mathematical theory that allows us to calculate and predict the results of the double-slit and many other experiments. If you think of quantum mechanics as an explanation as to what “really” goes on in the world, it can be rather confusing. However, if you simply “shut up and calculate” then it works amazingly well at predicting experimental results. In particular, in the double slit experiment, for any position in the wall, we can compute numbers  and  such that photons from the first and second slit hit that position with probabilities  and  respectively. When we open both slits, the probability that the position will be hit is proportional to , and so in particular, if  then it will be the case that, despite being hit when either slit one or slit two are open, the position is not hit at all when they both are. If you are confused by quantum mechanics, you are not alone: for decades people have been trying to come up with explanations for “the underlying reality” behind quantum mechanics, including Bohmian Mechanics, Many Worlds and others. However, none of these interpretations have gained universal acceptance and all of those (by design) yield the same experimental predictions. Thus at this point many scientists prefer to just ignore the question of what is the “true reality” and go back to simply “shutting up and calculating”.\\n\\nIf (like the author) you are a bit intimidated by complex numbers, don’t worry: you can think of all amplitudes as real (though potentially negative) numbers without loss of understanding. All the “magic” of quantum computing already arises in this case, and so we will often restrict attention to real amplitudes in this chapter.\\n\\nWe will also only discuss so-called pure quantum states, and not the more general notion of mixed states. Pure states turn out to be sufficient for understanding the algorithmic aspects of quantum computing.\\n\\nMore generally, this chapter is not meant to be a complete description of quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, or quantum computing, but rather illustrate the main points where these differ from classical computing.\\n\\nBell’s Inequality\\n\\nThere is something weird about quantum mechanics. In 1935 Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) tried to pinpoint this issue by highlighting a previously unrealized corollary of this theory. They showed that the idea that nature does not determine the results of an experiment until it is measured results in so called “spooky action at a distance”. Namely, making a measurement of one object may instantaneously effect the state (i.e., the vector of amplitudes) of another object in the other end of the universe.\\n\\nSince the vector of amplitudes is just a mathematical abstraction, the EPR paper was considered to be merely a thought experiment for philosophers to be concerned about, without bearing on experiments. This changed when in 1965 John Bell showed an actual experiment to test the predictions of EPR and hence pit intuitive common sense against the quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics won: it turns out that it is in fact possible to use measurements to create correlations between the states of objects far removed from one another that cannot be explained by any prior theory. Nonetheless, since the results of these experiments are so obviously wrong to anyone that has ever sat in an armchair, that there are still a number of Bell denialists arguing that this can’t be true and quantum mechanics is wrong.\\n\\nSo, what is this Bell’s Inequality? Suppose that Alice and Bob try to convince you they have telepathic ability, and they aim to prove it via the following experiment. Alice and Bob will be in separate closed rooms. You will interrogate Alice and your associate will interrogate Bob. You choose a random bit  and your associate chooses a random . We let  be Alice’s response and  be Bob’s response. We say that Alice and Bob win this experiment if . In other words, Alice and Bob need to output two bits that disagree if  and agree otherwise.\\n\\nNow if Alice and Bob are not telepathic, then they need to agree in advance on some strategy. It’s not hard for Alice and Bob to succeed with probability : just always output the same bit. Moreover, by doing some case analysis, we can show that no matter what strategy they use, Alice and Bob cannot succeed with higher probability than that:\\n\\n\\n\\nFor every two functions , .\\n\\nSince the probability is taken over all four choices of , the only way the theorem can be violated if if there exist two functions  that satisfy\\n\\n\\n\\nfor all the four choices of . Let’s plug in all these four choices and see what we get (below we use the equalities ,  and ):\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we XOR together the first and second equalities we get  while if we XOR together the third and fourth equalities we get , thus obtaining a contradiction.\\n\\nAn amazing experimentally verified fact is that quantum mechanics allows for “telepathy”. Specifically, it has been shown that using the weirdness of quantum mechanics, there is in fact a strategy for Alice and Bob to succeed in this game with probability larger than  (in fact, they can succeed with probability about , see bellstrategy).\\n\\nQuantum weirdness\\n\\nSome of the counterintuitive properties that arise from quantum mechanics include:\\n\\nInterference - As we’ve seen, quantum amplitudes can “cancel each other out”.\\n\\nMeasurement - The idea that amplitudes are negative as long as “no one is looking” and “collapse” (by squaring them) to positive probabilities when they are measured is deeply disturbing. Indeed, as shown by EPR and Bell, this leads to various strange outcomes such as “spooky actions at a distance”, where we can create correlations between the results of measurements in places far removed. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) these strange outcomes have been confirmed experimentally.\\n\\nEntanglement - The notion that two parts of the system could be connected in this weird way where measuring one will affect the other is known as quantum entanglement.\\n\\nAs counter-intuitive as these concepts are, they have been experimentally confirmed, so we just have to live with them.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe discussion in this lecture is quite brief and somewhat superficial. The chapter on quantum computation in my book with Arora (see draft here) is one relatively short resource that contains essentially everything we discuss here and more. See also this blog post of Aaronson for a high level explanation of Shor’s algorithm which ends with links to several more detailed expositions. This lecture of Aaronson contains a great discussion of the feasibility of quantum computing (Aaronson’s course lecture notes and the book that they spawned are fantastic reads as well). The videos of Umesh Vazirani’z EdX course are an accessible and recommended introduction to quantum computing. See the “bibliographical notes” section at the end of this chapter for more resources.\\n\\nQuantum computing and computation - an executive summary.\\n\\nOne of the strange aspects of the quantum-mechanical picture of the world is that unlike in the billiard ball example, there is no obvious algorithm to simulate the evolution of  particles over  time periods in  steps. In fact, the natural way to simulate  quantum particles will require a number of steps that is exponential in . This is a huge headache for scientists that actually need to do these calculations in practice.\\n\\nIn the 1981, physicist Richard Feynman proposed to “turn this lemon to lemonade” by making the following almost tautological observation:\\n\\nIf a physical system cannot be simulated by a computer in  steps, the system can be considered as performing a computation that would take more than  steps.\\n\\nSo, he asked whether one could design a quantum system such that its outcome  based on the initial condition  would be some function  such that (a) we don’t know how to efficiently compute in any other way, and (b) is actually useful for something. In 1985, David Deutsch formally suggested the notion of a quantum Turing machine, and the model has been since refined in works of Deutsch and Josza and Bernstein and Vazirani. Such a system is now known as a quantum computer.\\n\\nFor a while these hypothetical quantum computers seemed useful for one of two things. First, to provide a general-purpose mechanism to simulate a variety of the real quantum systems that people care about, such as various interactions inside molecules in quantum chemistry. Second, as a challenge to the Extended Church Turing hypothesis which says that every physically realizable computation device can be modeled (up to polynomial overhead) by Turing machines (or equivalently, NAND-TM / NAND-RAM programs).\\n\\nQuantum chemistry is important (and in particular understanding it can be a bottleneck for designing new materials, drugs, and more), but it is still a rather niche area within the broader context of computing (and even scientific computing) applications. Hence for a while most researchers (to the extent they were aware of it), thought of quantum computers as a theoretical curiosity that has little bearing to practice, given that this theoretical “extra power” of quantum computer seemed to offer little advantage in the majority of the problems people want to solve in areas such as combinatorial optimization, machine learning, data structures, etc..\\n\\nTo some extent this is still true today. As far as we know, quantum computers, if built, will not provide exponential speed ups for 95% of the applications of computing. In particular, as far as we know, quantum computers will not help us solve  complete problems in polynomial or even sub-exponential time, though Grover’s algorithm ( quantumnp) does yield a quadratic advantage in many cases.\\n\\nHowever, there is one cryptography-sized exception: In 1994 Peter Shor showed that quantum computers can solve the integer factoring and discrete logarithm problems in polynomial time. This result has captured the imagination of a great many people, and completely energized research into quantum computing. This is both because the hardness of these particular problems provides the foundations for securing such a huge part of our communications (and these days, our economy), and because it was a powerful demonstration that quantum computers could turn out to be useful for problems that a-priori seem to have nothing to do with quantum physics.\\n\\nAs we’ll discuss later, at the moment there are several intensive efforts to construct large scale quantum computers. It seems safe to say that, as far as we know, in the next five years or so there will not be a quantum computer large enough to factor, say, a  bit number. On the other hand, it does seem quite likely that in the very near future there will be quantum computers which achieve some task exponentially faster than the best-known way to achieve the same task with a classical computer. When and if a quantum computer is built that is strong enough to break reasonable parameters of Diffie Hellman, RSA and elliptic curve cryptography is anybody’s guess. It could also be a “self destroying prophecy” whereby the existence of a small-scale quantum computer would cause everyone to shift away to lattice-based crypto which in turn will diminish the motivation to invest the huge resources needed to build a large scale quantum computer.\\n\\nDespite popular accounts of quantum computers as having variables that can take “zero and one at the same time” and therefore can “explore an exponential number of possibilities simultaneously”, their true power is much more subtle and nuanced. In particular, as far as we know, quantum computers do not enable us to solve  complete problems such as 3SAT in polynomial or even sub-exponential time. However, Grover’s search algorithm does give a more modest advantage (namely, quadratic) for quantum computers over classical ones for problems in . In particular, due to Grover’s search algorithm, we know that the -SAT problem for  variables can be solved in time  on a quantum computer for every . In contrast, the best known algorithms for -SAT on a classical computer take roughly  steps.\\n\\nQuantum systems\\n\\nBefore we talk about quantum computing, let us recall how we physically realize “vanilla” or classical computing. We model a logical bit that can equal  or a  by some physical system that can be in one of two states. For example, it might be a wire with high or low voltage, charged or uncharged capacitor, or even (as we saw) a pipe with or without a flow of water, or the presence or absence of a soldier crab. A classical system of  bits is composed of  such “basic systems”, each of which can be in either a “zero” or “one” state. We can model the state of such a system by a string . If we perform an operation such as writing to the 17-th bit the NAND of the 3rd and 5th bits, this corresponds to applying a local function to  such as setting .\\n\\nIn the probabilistic setting, we would model the state of the system by a distribution. For an individual bit, we could model it by a pair of non-negative numbers  such that , where  is the probability that the bit is zero and  is the probability that the bit is one. For example, applying the negation (i.e., NOT) operation to this bit corresponds to mapping the pair  to  since the probability that  is equal to  is the same as the probability that  is equal to . This means that we can think of the NOT function as the linear map  such that  or equivalently as the matrix .\\n\\nIf we think of the -bit system as a whole, then since the  bits can take one of  possible values, we model the state of the system as a vector  of  probabilities. For every , we denote by  the  dimensional vector that has  in the coordinate corresponding to  (identifying it with a number in ), and so can write  as  where  is the probability that the system is in the state .\\n\\nApplying the operation above of setting the -th bit to the NAND of the 3rd and 5th bits, corresponds to transforming the vector  to the vector  where  is the linear map that maps  to .\\n\\nPlease make sure you understand why performing the operation will take a system in state  to a system in the state . Understanding the evolution of probabilistic systems is a prerequisite to understanding the evolution of quantum systems.\\n\\nIf your linear algebra is a bit rusty, now would be a good time to review it, and in particular make sure you are comfortable with the notions of matrices, vectors, (orthogonal and orthonormal) bases, and norms.\\n\\nQuantum amplitudes\\n\\nIn the quantum setting, the state of an individual bit (or “qubit”, to use quantum parlance) is modeled by a pair of numbers  such that . While in general these numbers can be complex, for the rest of this chapter, we will often assume they are real (though potentially negative), and hence often drop the absolute value operator. (This turns out not to make much of a difference in explanatory power.) As before, we think of  as the probability that the bit equals  and  as the probability that the bit equals . As we did before, we can model the NOT operation by the map  where .\\n\\nFollowing quantum tradition, instead of using  and  as we did above, from now on we will denote the vector  by  and the vector  by  (and moreover, think of these as column vectors). This is known as the Dirac “ket” notation. This means that NOT is the unique linear map  that satisfies  and . In other words, in the quantum case, as in the probabilistic case, NOT corresponds to the matrix\\n\\n\\n\\nIn classical computation, we typically think that there are only two operations that we can do on a single bit: keep it the same or negate it. In the quantum setting, a single bit operation corresponds to any linear map  that is norm preserving in the sense that for every , if we apply  to the vector  then we obtain a vector  such that . Such a linear map  corresponds to a unitary two by two matrix. Keeping the bit the same corresponds to the matrix  and (as we’ve seen) the NOT operations corresponds to the matrix . But there are other operations we can use as well. One such useful operation is the Hadamard operation, which corresponds to the matrix\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fact it turns out that Hadamard is all that we need to add to a classical universal basis to achieve the full power of quantum computing.\\n\\nRecap\\n\\nThe state of a quantum system of  qubits is modeled by an  dimensional vector  of unit norm (i.e., squares of all coordinates sums up to ), which we write as  where  is the column vector that has  in all coordinates except the one corresponding to  (identifying  with the numbers ). We use the convention that if  are strings of lengths  and  respectively then we can write the  dimensional vector with  in the -th coordinate and zero elsewhere not just as  but also as . In particular, for every , we can write the vector  also as . This notation satisfies certain nice distributive laws such as .\\n\\nA quantum operation on such a system is modeled by a  unitary matrix  (one that satisfies  where  is the transpose operation, or conjugate transpose for complex matrices). If the system is in state  and we apply to it the operation , then the new state of the system is .\\n\\nWhen we measure an -qubit system in a state , then we observe the value  with probability . In this case, the system collapses to the state .\\n\\nAnalysis of Bell’s Inequality (optional)\\n\\nNow that we have the notation in place, we can show a strategy for Alice and Bob to display “quantum telepathy” in Bell’s Game. Recall that in the classical case, Alice and Bob can succeed in the “Bell Game” with probability at most . We now show that quantum mechanics allows them to succeed with probability at least .\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is a 2-qubit quantum state  so that if Alice has access to the first qubit of , can manipulate and measure it and output  and Bob has access to the second qubit of  and can manipulate and measure it and output  then .\\n\\nAlice and Bob will start by preparing a 2-qubit quantum system in the state\\n\\n\\n\\n(this state is known as an EPR pair). Alice takes the first qubit of the system to her room, and Bob takes the qubit to his room. Now, when Alice receives  if  she does nothing and if  she applies the unitary map  to her qubit where  is the unitary operation corresponding to rotation in the plane with angle . When Bob receives , if  he does nothing and if  he applies the unitary map  to his qubit. Then each one of them measures their qubit and sends this as their response.\\n\\nRecall that to win the game Bob and Alice want their outputs to be more likely to differ if  and to be more likely to agree otherwise. We will split the analysis in one case for each of the four possible values of  and .\\n\\nCase 1:  and . If  then the state does not change. Because the state  is proportional to , the measurements of Bob and Alice will always agree (if Alice measures  then the state collapses to  and so Bob measures  as well, and similarly for ). Hence in the case , Alice and Bob always win.\\n\\nCase 2:  and . If  and  then after Alice measures her bit, if she gets  then the system collapses to the state , in which case after Bob performs his rotation, his qubit is in the state . Thus, when Bob measures his qubit, he will get  (and hence agree with Alice) with probability . Similarly, if Alice gets  then the system collapses to , in which case after rotation Bob’s qubit will be in the state  and so once again he will agree with Alice with probability .\\n\\nThe analysis for Case 3, where  and , is completely analogous to Case 2. Hence Alice and Bob will agree with probability  in this case as well.\\n\\nCase 4:  and . For the case that  and , after both Alice and Bob perform their rotations, the state will be proportional to\\n\\n\\n\\nIntuitively, since we rotate one state by 45 degrees and the other state by -45 degrees, they will become orthogonal to each other, and the measurements will behave like independent coin tosses that agree with probability 1/2. However, for the sake of completeness, we now show the full calculation.\\n\\nOpening up the coefficients and using  and , we can see that quantumbellcasefoureq is proportional to\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing the trigonometric identities  and , we see that the probability of getting any one of  is proportional to . Hence all four options for  are equally likely, which mean that in this case  with probability .\\n\\nTaking all the four cases together, the overall probability of winning the game is at least .\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is instructive to understand what about quantum mechanics enabled this gain in Bell’s Inequality. Consider the following analogous probabilistic strategy for Alice and Bob. They agree that each one of them will output  if they get  as input and output  with probability  if they get  as input. In this case one can see that their success probability would be . The quantum strategy we described above can be thought of as a variant of the probabilistic strategy for parameter  set to . But in the case , instead of disagreeing only with probability , we can use the negative probabilities in the quantum world and rotate the state in opposite directions. Therefore, the probability of disagreement ends up being .\\n\\nQuantum computation\\n\\nRecall that in the classical setting, we modeled computation as obtained by a sequence of basic operations. We had two types of computational models:\\n\\nNon uniform models of computation such as Boolean circuits and NAND-CIRC programs, where a finite function  is computable in size  if it can be expressed as a combination of  basic operations (gates in a circuit or lines in a NAND-CIRC program)\\n\\nUniform models of computation such as Turing machines and NAND-TM programs, where an infinite function  is computable in time  if there is a single algorithm that on input  evaluates  using at most  basic steps.\\n\\nWhen considering efficient computation, we defined the class  to consist of all infinite functions  that can be computed by a Turing machine or NAND-TM program in time  for some polynomial . We defined the class  to consists of all infinite functions  such that for every , the restriction  of  to  can be computed by a Boolean circuit or NAND-CIRC program of size at most  for some polynomial .\\n\\nWe will do the same for quantum computation, focusing mostly on the non uniform setting of quantum circuits, since that is simpler, and already illustrates the important differences with classical computing.\\n\\nQuantum circuits\\n\\nA quantum circuit is analogous to a Boolean circuit, and can be described as a directed acyclic graph. One crucial difference that the out degree of every vertex in a quantum circuit is at most one. This is because we cannot “reuse” quantum states without measuring them (which collapses their “probabilities”). Therefore, we cannot use the same qubit as input for two different gates. Another more technical difference is that to express our operations as unitary matrices, we will need to make sure all our gates are reversible. This is not hard to ensure. For example, in the quantum context, instead of thinking of  as a (non reversible) map from  to , we will think of it as the reversible map on three qubits that maps  to  (i.e., flip the last bit if  of the first two bits is ). Equivalently, the NAND operation corresponds to the  unitary matrix  such that (identifying  with ) for every , if  is the basis element with  in the -th coordinate and zero elsewhere, then . If we order the rows and columns as , then  can be written as the following matrix:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we have an  qubit system, then for , we will denote by  as the  unitary matrix that corresponds to applying  to the -th, -th, and -th bits, leaving the others intact. That is, for every , .\\n\\nAs mentioned above, we will also use the Hadamard or  operation. A quantum circuit is obtained by applying a sequence of  and  gates, which correspond to the matrix\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother way to define  is that for , . We define  to be the  unitary matrix that applies  to the -th qubit and leaves the others intact. Using the ket notation, we can write this as\\n\\n\\n\\nA quantum circuit is obtained by composing these basic operations on some  qubits. If , we use a circuit to compute a function :\\n\\nOn input , we initialize the system to hold  in the first  qubits, and initialize all remaining  qubits to zero.\\n\\nWe execute each elementary operation one by one.\\n\\nAt the end of the computation, we measure the system, and output the result of the last qubit (i.e.\\xa0the qubit in location ).\\n\\nWe say that the circuit computes , if the probability that this output equals  is at least . Note that this probability is obtained by summing up the squares of the amplitudes of all coordinates in the final state of the system corresponding to vectors  where .\\n\\nFormally this is defined as follows:\\n\\nA quantum circuit of  inputs and  gates over the  basis is a sequence of  unitary  matrices  such that each matrix  is either of the form  for  or  for .\\n\\nA quantum circuit computes a function  if the following is true for every :\\n\\nLet  be the vector\\n\\n\\n\\nand write  as . Then\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease stop here and see that this definition makes sense to you.\\n\\nOnce we have the notion of quantum circuits, we can define the quantum analog of  (i.e., define the class of functions computable by polynomial size quantum circuits) as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nLet . We say that  if there exists some polynomial  such that for every , if  is the restriction of  to inputs of length , then there is a quantum circuit of size at most  that computes .\\n\\nA priori it might seem “obvious” that quantum computing is exponentially powerful, since to perform a quantum computation on  bits we need to maintain the  dimensional state vector and apply  matrices to it. Indeed popular descriptions of quantum computing (too) often say something along the lines that the difference between quantum and classical computers is that a classical bit can either be zero or one while a qubit can be in both states at once, and so in many qubits a quantum computer can perform exponentially many computations at once.\\n\\nDepending on how you interpret it, this description is either false or would apply equally well to probabilistic computation, even though we’ve already seen that every randomized algorithm can be simulated by a similar-sized circuit, and in fact we conjecture that .\\n\\nMoreover, this “obvious” approach for simulating a quantum computation will take not just exponential time but exponential space as well, while it can be shown that using a simple recursive formula one can calculate the final quantum state using polynomial space (in physics this is known as “Feynman path integrals”). So, the exponentially long vector description by itself does not imply that quantum computers are exponentially powerful. Indeed, we cannot prove that they are (i.e., as far as we know, every QNAND-CIRC program could be simulated by a NAND-CIRC program with polynomial overhead), but we do have some problems (integer factoring most prominently) for which they do provide exponential speedup over the currently best known classical (deterministic or probabilistic) algorithms.\\n\\nQNAND-CIRC programs (optional)\\n\\nJust like in the classical case, there is an equivalence between circuits and straightline programs, and so we can define the programming language QNAND that is the quantum analog of our NAND-CIRC programming language. To do so, we only add a single operation: HAD(foo) which applies the single-bit operation  to the variable foo. We also use the following interpretation to make NAND reversible: foo = NAND(bar,blah) means that we modify foo to be the XOR of its original value and the NAND of bar and blah. (In other words, apply the  by  unitary transformation  defined above to the three qubits corresponding to foo, bar and blah.) If foo is initialized to zero then this makes no difference.\\n\\nIf  is a QNAND-CIRC program with  input variables,  workspace variables, and  output variables, then running it on the input  corresponds to setting up a system with  qubits and performing the following process:\\n\\nWe initialize the input variables X[]  X[] to  and all other variables to .\\n\\nWe execute the program line by line, applying the corresponding physical operation  or  to the qubits that are referred to by the line.\\n\\nWe measure the output variables Y[], , Y[] and output the result (if there is more than one output then we measure more variables).\\n\\nUniform computation\\n\\nJust as in the classical case, we can define uniform computational models. For example, we can define the QNAND-TM programming language to be QNAND augmented with loops and arrays just like NAND-TM is obtained from NAND. Using this we can define the class  which is the uniform analog of . Just as in the classical setting it holds that , in the quantum setting it can be shown that . Just like the classical case, we can also use Quantum Turing Machines instead of QNAND-TM to define .\\n\\nYet another way to define  is the following: a function  is in  if (1)  and (2) moreover for every , the quantum circuit that verifies this can be generated by a classical polynomial time NAND-TM program (or, equivalently, a polynomial-time Turing machine). We use this definition here, though an equivalent one can be made using QNAND-TM or quantum Turing machines:\\n\\n\\n\\nLet . We say that  if there exists a polynomial time NAND-TM program  such that for every ,  is the description of a quantum circuit  that computes the restriction of  to .\\n\\n\\n\\nOne way to verify that you’ve understood these definitions it to see that you can prove (1)  and in fact the stronger statement , (2) , and (3) For every -complete function , if  then . BQPcontainements asks you to work these out.\\n\\nThe relation between  and  is not known (see also quantumnp). It is widely believed that , but there is no consensus whether or not . It is quite possible that these two classes are incomparable, in the sense that  (and in particular no -complete function belongs to ) but also  (and there are some interesting candidates for such problems).\\n\\nIt can be shown that  (evaluating a quantum circuit on an input) is computable by a polynomial size QNAND-CIRC program, and moreover this program can even be generated uniformly and hence  is in . This allows us to “port” many of the results of classical computational complexity into the quantum realm as well.\\n\\nBecause the non uniform model is a little cleaner to work with, in the rest of this chapter we mostly restrict attention to this model, though all the algorithms we discuss can be implemented in uniform computation as well.\\n\\nPhysically realizing quantum computation\\n\\nTo realize quantum computation one needs to create a system with  independent binary states (i.e., “qubits”), and be able to manipulate small subsets of two or three of these qubits to change their state. While by the way we defined operations above it might seem that one needs to be able to perform arbitrary unitary operations on these two or three qubits, it turns out that there several choices for universal sets - a small constant number of gates that generate all others. The biggest challenge is how to keep the system from being measured and collapsing to a single classical combination of states. This is sometimes known as the coherence time of the system. The threshold theorem says that there is some absolute constant level of errors  so that if errors are created at every gate at rate smaller than  then we can recover from those and perform arbitrary long computations. (Of course there are different ways to model the errors and so there are actually several threshold theorems corresponding to various noise models).\\n\\nThere have been several proposals to build quantum computers:\\n\\nSuperconducting quantum computers use super-conducting electric circuits to do quantum computation. These are currently the devices with largest number of fully controllable qubits.\\n\\nAt Harvard, Lukin’s group is using cold atoms to implement quantum computers.\\n\\nTrapped ion quantum computers use the states of an ion to simulate a qubit. People have made some recent advances on these computers too. For example, an ion-trap computer was used to implement Shor’s algorithm to factor 15. (It turns out that  :) )\\n\\nTopological quantum computers use a different technology, which is more stable by design but arguably harder to manipulate to create quantum computers.\\n\\nThese approaches are not mutually exclusive and it could be that ultimately quantum computers are built by combining all of them together. At the moment, we have devices with about  qubits, and about  error per gate. Such restricted machines are sometimes called “Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers” or “NISQ”. See this article by John Preskil for some of the progress and applications of such more restricted devices. If the number of qubits is increased and the error is decreased by one or two orders of magnitude, we could start seeing more applications.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuperconducting quantum computer prototype at Google.

But could this “strangeness” be of any use to solve computational problems not directly related to quantum systems? A priori, one could guess the answer is no. In 1994 Peter Shor showed that one would be wrong:\\n\\nThere is a polynomial-time quantum algorithm that on input an integer  (represented in base two), outputs the prime factorization of .\\n\\nAnother way to state shorthm is that if we define  to be the function that on input a pair of numbers  outputs  if and only if  has a factor  such that , then  is in . This is an exponential improvement over the best known classical algorithms, which take roughly  time, where the  notation hides factors that are polylogarithmic in . While we will not prove shorthm in this chapter, we will sketch some of the ideas behind the proof.\\n\\nPeriod finding\\n\\nAt the heart of Shor’s Theorem is an efficient quantum algorithm for finding periods of a given function. For example, a function  is periodic if there is some  such that  for every  (e.g., see periodicfig).\\n\\n\\n\\nTop: A periodic function. Bottom: An a-periodic function.\\n\\nMusical notes yield one type of periodic function. When you pull on a string on a musical instrument, it vibrates in a repeating pattern. Hence, if we plot the speed of the string (and so also the speed of the air around it) as a function of time, it will correspond to some periodic function. The length of the period is known as the wave length of the note. The frequency is the number of times the function repeats itself within a unit of time. For example, the “Middle C” note has a frequency of  Hertz, which means its period is  seconds.\\n\\nIf we play a chord by playing several notes at once, we get a more complex periodic function obtained by combining the functions of the individual notes (see timefreqfig). The human ear contains many small hairs, each of which is sensitive to a narrow band of frequencies. Hence when we hear the sound corresponding to a chord, the hairs in our ears actually separate it out to the components corresponding to each frequency.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeft: The air-pressure when playing a “C Major” chord as a function of time. Right: The coefficients of the Fourier transform of the same function, we can see that it is the sum of three freuencies corresponding to the C, E and G notes (261.63, 329.63 and 392 Hertz respectively). Credit: Bjarke Mønsted’s Quora answer.\\n\\nIt turns out that (essentially) every periodic function  can be decomposed into a sum of simple wave functions (namely functions of the form  or ). This is known as the Fourier Transform (see qfourierfig). The Fourier transform makes it easy to compute the period of a given function: it will simply be the least common multiple of the periods of the constituent waves.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf  is a periodic function then when we represent it in the Fourier transform, we expect the coefficients corresponding to wavelengths that do not evenly divide the period to be very small, as they would tend to “cancel out”.\\n\\nShor’s Algorithm: A bird’s eye view\\n\\nOn input a an integer , Shor’s algorithm outputs the prime factorization of  in time that is polynomial in . The main steps in the algorithm are the following:\\n\\nStep 1: Reduce to period finding. The first step in the algorithm is to pick a random  and define the function  as  where we identify the string  with an integer using the binary representation, and similarly represent the integer  as a string. (We will choose  to be some polynomial in  and so in particular  is a large enough set to represent all the numbers in ).\\n\\nSome not-too-hard (though somewhat technical) calculations show that: (1) The function  is periodic (i.e., there is some integer  such that  for almost every ) and more importantly (2) If we can recover the period  of  for several randomly chosen ’s, then we can recover the factorization of . Hence, factoring  reduces to finding out the period of the function . dlogfromorder asks you to work out this for the related task of computing the discrete logarithm (which underlies the security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and elliptic curve cryptography).\\n\\nStep 2: Period finding via the Quantum Fourier Transform. Using a simple trick known as “repeated squaring”, it is possible to compute the map  in time polynomial in , which means we can also compute this map using a polynomial number of NAND gates,and so in particular we can generate in polynomial quantum time a quantum state  that is (up to normalization) equal to\\n\\n\\n\\nIn particular, if we were to measure the state , we would get a random pair of the form  where . So far, this is not at all impressive. After all, we did not need the power of quantum computing to generate such pairs: we could simply generate a random  and then compute .\\n\\nAnother way to describe the state  is that the coefficient of  in  is proportional to  where  is the function such that\\n\\n\\n\\nThe magic of Shor’s algorithm comes from a procedure known as the Quantum Fourier Transform. It allows to change the state  into the state  where the coefficient of  is now proportional to the -th Fourier coefficient of . In other words, if we measure the state , we will obtain a pair  such that the probability of choosing  is proportional to the square of the weight of the frequency  in the representation of the function . Since for every , the function  has the period , it can be shown that the frequency  will be (almost) a multiple of . If we make several such samples  and obtain the frequencies , then the true period  divides all of them, and it can be shown that it is going to be in fact the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of all these frequencies: a value which can be computed in polynomial time.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, we can recover the factorization of  from the periods of  for some randomly chosen  in  and  which is polynomial in .\\n\\nThe resulting algorithm can be described in a high (and somewhat inaccurate) level as follows:\\n\\nShor’s Algorithm: (sketch)\\n\\nInput: Number .\\n\\nOutput: Prime factorization of .\\n\\nOperations:\\n\\nRepeat the following  number of times:\\n\\nChoose  at random, and let  be the map .\\n\\nFor , repeat  times the following step: Quantum Fourier Transform to create a quantum state  over  qubits, such that if we measure  we obtain a pair of strings  with probability proportional to the square of the coefficient corresponding to the wave function  or  in the Fourier transform of the function  defined as  iff .\\n\\nIf  are the coefficients we obtained in the previous step, then the least common multiple of  is likely to be the period of the function .\\n\\nIf we let  and  be the numbers we chose in the previous step and the corresponding periods of the functions  then we can use classical results in number theory to obtain from these a non-trivial prime factor  of  (if such exists). We can now run the algorithm again with the (smaller) input  to obtain all other factors.\\n\\nReducing factoring to order finding is cummbersome, but can be done in polynomial time using a classical computer. The key quantum ingredient in Shor’s algorithm is the quantum fourier transform.\\n\\nDespite its name, the Quantum Fourier Transform does not actually give a way to compute the Fourier Transform of a function . This would be impossible to do in time polynomial in , as simply writing down the Fourier Transform would require  coefficients. Rather the Quantum Fourier Transform gives a quantum state where the amplitude corresponding to an element (think: frequency)  is equal to the corresponding Fourier coefficient. This allows to sample from a distribution where  is drawn with probability proportional to the square of its Fourier coefficient. This is not the same as computing the Fourier transform, but is good enough for recovering the period.\\n\\nQuantum Fourier Transform (advanced, optional)\\n\\nThe above description of Shor’s algorithm skipped over the implementation of the main quantum ingredient: the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm. In this section we discuss the ideas behind this algorithm. We will be rather brief and imprecise. quantumsources and quantumbibnotessec contain references to sources of more information about this topic.\\n\\nTo understand the Quantum Fourier Transform, we need to better understand the Fourier Transform itself. In particular, we will need to understand how it applies not just to functions whose input is a real number but to functions whose domain can be any arbitrary commutative group. Therefore we now take a short detour to (very basic) group theory, and define the notion of periodic functions over groups.\\n\\nWhile we define the concepts we use, some background in group or number theory might be quite helpful for fully understanding this section.\\n\\nWe will not use anything more than the basic properties of finite Abelian groups. Specifically we use the following notions:\\n\\nA finite group  can be thought of as simply a set of elements and some binary operation  on these elements (i.e., if  then  is an element of  as well).\\n\\nThe operation  satisfies the sort of properties that a product operation does, namely, it is associative (i.e., ) and there is some element  such that  for all , and for every  there exists an element  such that .\\n\\nA group is called commutative (also known as Abelian) if  for all .\\n\\nThe Fourier transform is a deep and vast topic, on which we will barely touch upon here. Over the real numbers, the Fourier transform of a function  is obtained by expressing  in the form  where the ’s are “wave functions” (e.g.\\xa0sines and cosines). However, it turns out that the same notion exists for every Abelian group . Specifically, for every such group , if  is a function mapping  to , then we can write  as\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere the ’s are functions mapping  to  that are analogs of the “wave functions” for the group  and for every ,  is a complex number known as the Fourier coefficient of  corresponding to . The representation fourierexpansion is known as the Fourier expansion or Fourier transform of , the numbers  are known as the Fourier coefficients of  and the functions  are known as the Fourier characters. The central property of the Fourier characters is that they are homomorphisms of the group into the complex numbers, in the sense that for every , , where  is the group operation. One corollary of this property is that if  then  is  periodic in the sense that  for every . It turns out that if  is periodic with minimal period , then the only Fourier characters that have non zero coefficients in the expression fourierexpansion are those that are  periodic as well. This can be used to recover the period of  from its Fourier expansion.\\n\\nQuantum Fourier Transform over the Boolean Cube: Simon’s Algorithm\\n\\nWe now describe the simplest setting of the Quantum Fourier Transform: the group  with the XOR operation, which we’ll denote by . It can be shown that the Fourier transform over  corresponds to expressing  as\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  is defined as  and .\\n\\nThe Quantum Fourier Transform over  is actually qutie simple:\\n\\nLet  be a quantum state where  is some function satisfying . Then we can use  gates to transform  to the state\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  and  is the function .\\n\\n\\n\\nThe idea behind the proof is that the Hadamard operation corresponds to the Fourier transform over the group  (with the XOR operations). To show this, we just need to do the calculations.\\n\\nWe can express the Hadamard operation  as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are given the state\\n\\n\\n\\nNow suppose that we apply the  operation to each of the  qubits. We can see that we get the state\\n\\n\\n\\nWe can now use the distributive law and open up a term of the form\\n\\n\\n\\nto the following sum over  terms:\\n\\n\\n\\nBut by changing the order of summations, we see that the final state is\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich exactly corresponds to .\\n\\nFrom Fourier to Period finding: Simon’s Algorithm (advanced, optional)\\n\\nUsing QFTcube it is not hard to get an algorithm that can recover a string  given a circuit that computes a function  that is  periodic in the sense that  for distinct  if and only if . The key observation is that if we compute the state , and perform the Quantum Fourier transform on the first  qubits, then we would get a state such that the only basis elements with nonzero coefficients would be of the form  where\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, by measuring the state, we can obtain a sample of a random  satisfying eq:periodbooleanqft. But since eq:periodbooleanqft is a linear equation modulo  about the unknown  variables , if we repeat this procedure to get  such equations, we will have at least as many equations as variables and (it can be shown that) this will suffice to recover .\\n\\nThis result is known as Simon’s Algorithm, and it preceded and inspired Shor’s algorithm.\\n\\nFrom Simon to Shor (advanced, optional)\\n\\nQFTcube seemed to really use the special bit-wise structure of the group , and so one could wonder if it can be extended to other groups. However, it turns out that we can in fact achieve such a generalization.\\n\\nThe key step in Shor’s algorithm is to implement the Fourier transform for the group  which is the set of numbers  with the operation being addition modulo . In this case it turns out that the Fourier characters are the functions  where  ( here denotes the complex number ). The -th Fourier coefficient of a function  is\\n\\n\\n\\nThe key to implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform for such groups is to use the same recursive equations that enable the classical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. Specifically, consider the case that . We can separate the sum over  in fouriercoeffmodular to the terms corresponding to even ’s (of the form ) and odd ’s (of the form ) to obtain\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich reduces computing the Fourier transform of  over the group  to computing the Fourier transform of the functions  and  (corresponding to the applying  to only the even and odd ’s respectively) which have  inputs that we can identify with the group .\\n\\nSpecifically, the Fourier characters of the group  are the functions  for every . Moreover, since ,  for every . Thus eqfftrecurse translates into\\n\\n\\n\\nThis observation is usually used to obtain a fast (e.g.\\xa0) time to compute the Fourier transform in a classical setting, but it can be used to obtain a quantum circuit of  gates to transform a state of the form  to a state of the form .\\n\\nThe case that  is not an exact power of two causes some complications in both the classical case of the Fast Fourier Transform and the quantum setting of Shor’s algorithm. However, it is possible to handle these. The idea is that we can embed  in the group  for any integer , and we can find an integer  such that  will be close enough to a power of  (i.e., a number of the form  for some ), so that if we do the Fourier transform over the group  then we will not introduce too many errors.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe state of an -qubit quantum system can be modeled as a  dimensional vector.\\n\\nAn operation on the state corresponds to applying a unitary matrix to this vector.\\n\\nQuantum circuits are obtained by composing basic operations such as  and .\\n\\nWe can use quantum circuits to define the classes  and , which are the quantum analogs of  and  respectively.\\n\\nThere are some problems for which the best known quantum algorithm is exponentially faster than the best known, but quantum computing is not a panacea. In particular, as far as we know, quantum computers could still require exponential time to solve -complete problems such as .\\n\\nExercises\\n\\nMost of the exercises have been written in the summer of 2018 and haven’t yet been fully debugged. While I would prefer people do not post online solutions to the exercises, I would greatly appreciate if you let me know of any bugs. You can do so by posting a GitHub issue about the exercise, and optionally complement this with an email to me with more details about the attempted solution.\\n\\nProve the following relations between quantum complexity classes and classical ones:\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\nIf  then .\\n\\nShow a probabilistic polynomial time classical algorithm that given an Abelian finite group  (in the form of an algorithm that computes the group operation), a generator  for the group, and an element , as well access to a black box that on input  outputs the order of  (the smallest  such that ), computes the discrete logarithm of  with respect to . That is the algorithm should output a number  such that .
